###Description

An implementation of a HeapSort approach for sorting an array of integers.

The type of data can be changed, but have in mind that you would
probably need to define your own comparator.

###Usage

####Input
<b>n</b> - number of elements in array.
Then n lines, each one containing some piece of data (i.e. integer).

####Output
Just an array of given data sorted in non-decresing order. 
Order can be changed easily.
