CodeLibrary
===========

A storage for the most commonly used algorithms and data structures. 

Please note that we are currently working to make this library as usefull as possible by
adding kind of readme file to every code, which contains important pieces of information
such as detailed instructions how to use it, what is the input/output and some significant assumptions we made
during the process of implementation. We are also providing information about the problems (usually from SPOJ.com) 
solved by explicit or implicit (i.e some easy modification) useage of a particular algo. 

You may consider it as a spoiler in some case, so be aware that our intention is to deliver you a confirmation of correctness of a particular implementation, not a detailed solution.

However in early development some of the codes may be flaged as [UNTESTED] just to inform you, that they might have a nonzero probability of failing in some cases :-) Still we are doing our best to avoid that uncertainity.
