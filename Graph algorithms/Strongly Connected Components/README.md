###Description

An implementation of DFS-like algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a given graph.

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m</b> - number of vertices and number of edges respectively. <br>
Then m lines, each line describing a directed edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>). <br> 

####Output

Simply the vertices partitioned into strongly connected subgraphs. 

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices. <br>
