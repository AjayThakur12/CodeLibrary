###Description

An implementation of a Hopcroft-Karp's approach for finding Max Matching in a bipartite graph. 

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m, p</b> - number of vertices in first group, number of vertices in second group and number of edges respectively, then p lines, each line describing an undirected edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>) which starts in first and ends in second group.<br>

<b>Vertices in either first or second group starts with 0!</b> <br>
However it is easy to remove that constraint :)


####Output

Simply the value of a maximal matching :) <br> The actual matching is stored in match[] array.  

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices (sum of both groups). <br>
<b>INF</b>  - any number greater than MAXN. <br>
