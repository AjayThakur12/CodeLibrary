###Description

An implementation of an eliminative approach for finding topological order of the directed acyclic graph. This implementation detects whether the graph is a DAG or not.  

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m</b> - number of vertices and number of edges respectively. <br>
Then m lines, each line describing a directed edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>). <br> 

Vertices starts with 0.

####Output

Simply the vertices in a topological order (lexicographically).

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices. <br>
