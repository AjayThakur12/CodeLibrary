###Description

An implementation of a Depth First approach for searching the graph.

###Usage

####Input

<b>n, m</b> - number of vertices and number of edges respectively. <br>
Then m lines, each line describing an undirected edge (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>). <br> 

However it is easy to change the implementation for the direct edges. 

Vertices starts with 0.

####Output

There is no specific output. This approach allows us to execute some further operations on a DFS ordered tree.

####Additional comments

<b>MAXN</b> - maximal number of vertices. <br>
