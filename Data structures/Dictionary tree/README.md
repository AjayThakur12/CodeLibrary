###Description

An implementation of a data structure called Dictionary Tree (also known as Trie). It allows us to efficiently search for words in a self-made dictionary.<br>
 
There are three implementations, each one constructed for a different alphabhet (a-z, A-Z or 0-9). Combaining them is also possible, but usually only one is needed. 

###Usage

####Input

<b>n</b> - number of words. <br>
Then n words, each one will be added to a dictionary.  <br>

####Output

There is no specific output. <br>
Currently the lexicographically sorted list of words from our dictionary will appear. </br>
